# Welcome to the Lexi-meter

The Curiosity Club at Praelexis are creating our own multiplayer quiz game, inspired by MentiMeter. We are calling it the Lexi-meter. We are using this project to learn about the different components of application development such as API's, databases, front-end and back-end development, and more. 

We are tracking our progress in a shored [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cDz2bUMo_afF7RDJvapllW48O4g1E49tavE8lWS-4CM/edit?usp=sharing) which you should check out if you are interested in our progress.
